# Geospatial

Whatever I learn about geospatial problems and code.

[This site](http://www.edwilliams.org/avform147.htm#LL) - I was led here by [this Stackoverflow](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/5821/calculating-latitude-longitude-x-miles-from-point) is helpful about figuring out the great circle.

[Here](https://guides.library.duke.edu/r-geospatial/CRS) is a useful starting list of projection EPSG codes and what they are used for.

[This](https://epsg.io/4148) is a EPSG which projects a familiar map of South Africa.
